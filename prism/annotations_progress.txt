source activate tensorflow_env
jupyter notebook
open Demo_yourowndata notebook
run the cells until(!!!) "Label the extracted frames" section
load one of the "to be annotated" folder

adjust the marker size to 3 (yeah the GUI works very badly)

Subsequently, the user can use one of the radio buttons (top right) to select a body part to label.
RIGHT click to add the label. Left click to drag the label, if needed.
If you label a part accidentally, you can use the middle button on your mouse to delete!

!!! If you cannot see a body part in the frame, skip over the label !!!

!!! Not labeled images (not even one label) are classified as UNWANTED !!!
just click "next" for the unwanted frames

The user needs to save the labels by clicking the save button at the bottom right.
! I suggest you to save after you finish each folder !

Saving the labels will create a dataset for each video in a hierarchical data file format (HDF)
in the subdirectory corresponding to the particular video in labeled-data.
You can save at any intermediate step and you return to labeling a dataset by reloading it.
